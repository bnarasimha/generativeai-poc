I am thinking of breaking it down even more.  I was so excited when I saw the first presenter talk about jcl and showed jcl ... but then they lost me - today if I need to update a dsn in jcl, I go into the editor update it done and can run immediately and tell if I have a typo or not.  How does that work in the new world ... looks like it would take several steps before even being able to test to see if I had a typo ... it would of helped me to see the jcl go all the way through the process from update to running the jcl.  I understand the general concepts ... but how to convert what I do today to tomorrow ... not getting the picture.","","see above","","10","",""
